Reverse SiteUrls for DNN (former DotNetNuke)
<p><strong>About Reverse SiteUrls</strong><br /> This is additional to Core FriendlyUrlProvider makes reverse search in the SiteUrls.config. Right now click in the menu shows URLs like http://site.com/About/tabid/40/Default.aspx<br /> Ever you have analog About.aspx for tabid=40 in the SiteUrls. This addon helps to fix it.<br /> <br /> DotNetNuke made very good solution for custom URLs. This is SiteUrls.config file. It allows to add to this file something like this:<br /> <br /> &lt;RewriterRule&gt;<br /> &lt;LookFor&gt;.*/About.aspx&lt;/LookFor&gt;<br /> &lt;SendTo&gt;~/Default.aspx?TabID=40&lt;/SendTo&gt;<br /> &lt;/RewriterRule&gt;<br /> <br /> When your customers type something like http://mysite.com/About.aspx DotNetNuke Portals shows correct page from tabid=40. Issue happens when you click this page in the menu. Instead http://mysite.com/About.aspx it shows http://mysite.com/About/tabid/40/Default.aspx.<br /> <br /> It confuses clients and search bots. Bots can penalize, because it looks like duplicates of content. This is why this additional has been made by <a href="http://forDNN.com" target="_blank">forDNN Team</a>. It makes reverse lookup in the SiteUrls.config and replaces with related URL (if any).<br /> </p>
